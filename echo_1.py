# the following code will serve to help you learn how to work with user inputs. 
# 
# The next line will get a user's input by asking them a question.
number = input ('Enter your favorite number: ')
# the line above will only work for a number; input works only for numbers,
# while raw_input works only for string (which could also be a sting of numerical 
# characters)

string = raw_input('Enter your favorite word: ')
# raw_input often is the safest operation to use because it can accept virtually anyting 

# using what you know from the hello_world program, try to echo, or print, what the user
# inputs (both the number and string). Challenge: print them together (Note: you have 
# not yet learned how to do this yet)
# Enter code below:



# Once you are done with that, create a brief program below that asks for the user's
# name and birthday and then prints their name and birthday. Run it. Hint: you only 
# need to use raw_input. 
# Enter code below:
