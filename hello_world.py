# The following code will serve to act as an introduction to the basic elements of Python 
# through the creation of a hello world program. 

# Comments are made by entering the hashtag # at the beginning of a line. Anything after the 
# hashtag will not be read by your computer, so you can use comments to make your code
# clear to your reader, as I am doing now. The first couple programs will be comment-intensive,
# but as we get better there will be more code and less of my comments. 

# Lets start with a simple function that is built into Python, called print
print "Hello, World!"

print ("Hello, World!")

# Notice how you will get an error on line 10, that is because all functions need a parenthesis 
# to operate properly. Using this knowledge, put a hashtag # in the begninning of the line that 
# you think that is wrong so that the computer will ignore it. 

# If you chose right, the computer should have printed Hello World! This is a common test that
# software engineers will use to make sure that their code is working properly. 

# Now, we are going to use a varable, and print what the variable is. 

x = "Trent"
print ("Nice to meet you, " + x)

# Try changing the name stored in the variable, Trent, to your name. Make sure the save the
# program before running it (Note this note might not be applicable if you are using repl.it)
# Notice how when you run the program again, the name Trent changes to the name that you 
# changed Trent to. The variable x stores what is called a string. A string can be 
# anything from a character (not in java, another programming language, but we'll 
# keep it simple for now) to a long essay. You can think of a string as stringing together
# a whole bunch of characters (including but not limited to alphabetical characters!) to create 
# something larger and hopefully more meaningfull :). 

# now, try and declare a varable (declare just means to set a variable equal to something in this
# case), and print it!
# type code below



# If your program worked, great job! We will continue with this more next lesson (or if everybody
# is extra speedy, in a couple minutes when everyone finishes!).
# To move on to the next program, open and paste
