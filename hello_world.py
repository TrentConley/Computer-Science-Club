# The following code will serve to act as an introduction to the basic elements of Python 
# through the creation of a hello world program. 

# Comments are made by entering the hashtag # at the beginning of a line. Anything after the 
# hashtag will not be read by your computer, so you can use comments to make your code
# clear to your reader, as I am doing now. 

# Lets start with a simple function that is built into Python, called print
print "Hello, World!"

print ("Hello, World!")

# Notice how you will get an error on line 9, that is because all functions need a parenthesis 
# to operate properly. Using this knowledge, put a hashtag # in the begninning of the line that 
# you think that is wrong so that the computer will ignore it. 

# If you chose right, the computer should have printed Hello World! This is a common test that
# software engineers will use to make sure that their code is working properly. 

# Now, we are going to use a varable, and print what the variable is.
