# Shift_1.py

# In this program, you will learn how to manpulate user input even more. 

# Get user input:

my_string = 

# get the first character of the string

first_character = 

first_character_number_plus_one = ord(first_character) + 1
# the ord function will turn the character into a number, using an ASCII table. 
# You don't need an ASCII table, however to do useful things. 
# I also added one to the value, which will shift the letter over one.
# For example, an 'b' will turn into a 'b' and 'm' to 'n' 

first_character_shift_one = chr(first_character_number_plus_one)
# The chr function does the opposite of the ord function, numbers turn into characters. 

print (first_character_shift_one)
# the line above will shift the letter over 1. 
# For example, an 'a' will turn into a 'b'. 

# using what you know from echo_2 and above, add two to every
# letter of a my_string, the user input. 
# Enter code below:
